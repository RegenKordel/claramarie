title: "ReqVision: Digitising Your Analog Notes into Readable and Editable Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-ReqVision
excerpt: 'The paper describes the problem of collecting, merging, and sharing information from workshops and conference notes in order to achieve better cooperation between stakeholders, thus improving collaboration during product development. We provide an overview of apps for Android and iOS devices that can facilitate this problem. We tested these apps on their recognition of handwritten and printed text and their integration into existing services, but none of them met all desired requirements. We propose an approach that includes a self-adaptive part to improve handwritten text recognition as well as a context-sensitive part to facilitate the integration into existing systems in the context of the Smart RE framework.'
