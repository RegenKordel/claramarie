My name is Clara Marie LÃ¼ders and I love data, machine learning, and mathematics.

I studied business mathmatics for my bachelor degree, mathematics for my master degree, and am currently doing my PhD in computer science.

My research interests include AI (machine and deep learning), Graph Theory, Natural Language Processing, Issue Tracking Systems / Knowledge Management, and Neuroscience.

I also enjoy gaming, esports, martial arts, and learning. I also advocate for more diversity in gaming during my free time.

Reach out if you want to discuss research with me.
